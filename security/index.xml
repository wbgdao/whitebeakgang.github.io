Many Discord integrations prompt you to connect metamask or enter some other potentially sensitive information. It&amp;rsquo;s important to be cautious when using this platform and clicking links or interacting with bots. Direct Messages containing spammy and potentially malicious links are common and must be treated appropriately. Always verify Direct Messages you receive are truly from the person you think and not someone posing as a trusted individual.</description></item><item><title>Keyloggers and Malware</title><link>https://whitebeakgang.com/security/malware/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://whitebeakgang.com/security/malware/</guid><description>Software designed for a malicous purpose is referred to as Malware Malware comes in many forms and may infect your devices in different ways Keyloggers are a type of malware that monitor your typing and record keystrokes being sent to your keyboard This data can be sent to other servers to people looking to abuse this info (credit cards, passwords, contacts, recovery seeds) Back to Security Module</description></item><item><title>Malicious Smart Contracts</title><link>https://whitebeakgang.com/security/malicious-smart-contracts/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://whitebeakgang.com/security/malicious-smart-contracts/</guid><description>Just like traditional software applications, a dApp may also contain vulnerabilities. These may sometimes be accidentally introduced through inexperienced or careless developers or intentially by more malicious parties. A malicious smart contract may attempt to trick you into paying an exorbitant amount of crypto to the contract/address or transfer your other assets/NFTs against your will. Enabling 2 Factor and using a Hardware Wallet are critical steps to prevent being vulnerable to these exploits.</description></item><item><title>Passwords</title><link>https://whitebeakgang.com/security/passwords/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://whitebeakgang.com/security/passwords/</guid><description>Keep your passwords safe and secure.

These airdropped NFTs tend to be scams and are involved in a variety of attacks. A dusting attack will track wallets that attempt to spend or sell these assets which allows the trackers to deanonymize wallet addresses and better social engineer them. Potentially malicious smart contracts may also be connected to these NFTs that will prompt you to transfer crypto and other assets out of your wallet when attempting to sell or transfer the airdropped NFT.</description></item><item><title>Scams</title><link>https://whitebeakgang.com/security/scams/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://whitebeakgang.com/security/scams/</guid><description>As with any potentially profitable field, there are many scammers in the Crypto, Blockchain, and NFT space. If an offer sounds too good to be true, it generally is too good to be true and should be approached with extreme skepticism. Always check with other trusted communities when presented with something that seems like a scam. Scams are only effective when the targets don&amp;rsquo;t know what to be on the lookout for.</description></item><item><title>Software and Hardware Wallets</title><link>https://whitebeakgang.com/security/crypto-wallets/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://whitebeakgang.com/security/crypto-wallets/</guid><description>Software wallets such as Metamask and Coinbase Wallet exist as programs/browser extensions on your devices and often are partly custodied with a third party Hardware wallets like Ledger and Trezor run on physical devices with your private keys stored on the device instead of your connected devices or online Connecting a hardware wallet to a software wallet like Metamask allows the hardware wallet to be used as a 2FA device requiring you to approve transactions both in the software and on the physical device Using the combination of a Software and Hardware wallet allows you to conveniently access your favorite dApps without compromising on security Back to Security Module</description></item><item><title>VPNs and Network</title><link>https://whitebeakgang.com/security/vpn-networks/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://whitebeakgang.com/security/vpn-networks/</guid><description>Avoid using public/shared networks if possible.
